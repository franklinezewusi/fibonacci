# fibonacci
I created a function and named it "generating_fibonacci and passed in a parameter called (n)
I also made an empty list called fibonacci_sequence and a two variables a, b
then i assigned the two variable a, b to 0, 1
I ran a while loop and passed a condition that if 0 <= my argument(n)
the given value will iterable as far as the condition is True, then it will keep modifying and appending to the empty list
then i passed an argument(50) in the calling process, which represent the (n) parameter in the function defination 
I created a variable answer that store the called function and printed the variable
